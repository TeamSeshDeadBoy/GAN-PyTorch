# PokeGAN - Generating Pokemon images

My implementation of various GAN model architectures generating Pokemon images.  
Built fully with PyTorch.  
 Why Pokemon?  
 Because.

### Built using **PyTorch**

## ProGAN Model

![img](images/markdown_cache/image.png)

My implementation of ProGAN architecture, built with **PyTorch**.  
Generates images based on a *Pokemon Generations Dataset* [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/truthisneverlinear/pokemon-generations-image-dataset)  
Due to my limitations in GPU power, i was able to train it only for small number of epochs (approx. 50 for 32x32 img resolutions, each taking about 1.5hr on my 1060 TI laptop GPU v-v)
